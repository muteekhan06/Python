# Comments increase the readability of the program
# The comments are used to explain the purpose and functionality of a particular section or block of code.
# They help in understanding the logic behind the program, making it easier for others (and future you) to understand your work.
# --> This is an example of a single-line comment in Python programming language
# Multi-line comments can span multiple lines, making them ideal for explaining large sections of code
